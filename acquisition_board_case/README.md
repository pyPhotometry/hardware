Plastic case compatible with both version v1 and v2 acquisition boards.  The repository contains the Fusion 360 design file (.f3z) and an stl file for 3D printing.

### Assembly:

1. 3D print the file `case_body.stl` using selective laser sintering (SLS) in Nylon PA12.

2. Insert thread inserts into body using gentle pressure with soldering iron set to 220 centigrade.  

   The 4 thread inserts on the bottom of the case are optional but allow the case to be mounted using M3 screws (hole spacing 60x50mm).

3. Position board in case and attach with M3 screws.
